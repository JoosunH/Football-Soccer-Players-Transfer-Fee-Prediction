# Football-Soccer-Players-Transfer-Fee-Prediction
Developing a predictive model for football player transfer fees involves leveraging a comprehensive dataset encompassing fundamental player attributes and professional performance metrics. These attributes include age, height, playing position, as well as statistical indicators such as goal-scoring and assists for the seasons 2021-2022 and 2022-2023. Additionally, the dataset incorporates information on injuries, cumulative individual and team awards throughout the player's career.

The dataset spans multiple European leagues, including the Premier League and Championship in England, Bundesliga in Germany, La Liga in Spain, Serie A in Italy, Ligue 1 in France, Eredivisie in the Netherlands, Liga NOS in Portugal, Premier Liga in Russia, Super Lig in Turkey, and Bundesliga in Austria.

Furthermore, it encompasses four American leagues: Brasileiro in Brazil, Major League Soccer in the United States, Primera Divisi√≥n in Argentina, and Liga MX in Mexico. Additionally, the dataset includes representation from the DStv Premiership in South Africa for African leagues, and for Asian leagues, it covers J-League in Japan, Saudi Pro League in Saudi Arabia, K-League 1 in South Korea, and A-League in Australia.

Utilizing this diverse and extensive dataset, the model aims to discern patterns and correlations between player attributes and transfer fees across different leagues, contributing to a nuanced understanding of valuation dynamics in the football transfer market.
